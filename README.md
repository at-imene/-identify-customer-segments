# Identify-Customer-Segments
This project was completed as part of the Udacity Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree requirements

# Project Overview
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

The data was provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solution. There are two dataset provided first was demographic data (891,211 individuals)for the general population of Germany and the second dataset was demographic data for customers of a mail-order company (191,652 individuals). Both dataset consists of 85 different features.

# Project steps:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature selection (using PCA)
3. Clustering (using kmeans)
4. Result interpretation
